            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Nature is made of everything we see around us â€“ trees, flowers, plants, animals, sky, mountains, forests
                and more. Human beings depend on nature to stay alive. Nature helps us breathe, gives us food, water,
                shelter, medicines, and clothes. We find many colors in nature which make the Earth beautiful.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Animals, fish and insects also get their food and shelter from nature. Different trees grow up due to
                sunlight and water provided by nature. Humans should stop causing harm to the elements of nature for
                their needs. Nature is very important to maintain the growth and balance of life on earth.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Life in a city is a really busy life. People who live in big cities,
                they are always busy. Some of them are busy with their business and some of them are busy with their
                job. In the morning, in a big city, you will find people doing morning walk or exercise.

            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                A few hours later traffic becomes heavier than morning and people start to come out. Students go to
                their school, college, and university. Students are a big part of every city. Sometimes city life is
                really interesting, especially in any celebration. I like city life a lot.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Fruits are important sources of vitamins and carbohydrates like fiber
                and sugar. They are low in calories and naturally sweet. Fruits and their juices are good sources of
                water, too.Different fruits contain different vitamins, so it is important to eat a variety of fruits.
                Mangoes,
                papayas, melons and citrus fruits, like oranges and grapefruit, are high in vitamin C. Cantaloupe,
                apricots, peaches, and nectarines are sources of vitamin A.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Whole fruits like apples and grapes contain more fiber than fruit juices and sauces, like applesauce and
                grape juice. Dried fruits like figs, prunes and raisins are good sources of fiber, too. Canned fruits
                packed in syrup have a lot of added sugar. They are higher in calories than fresh fruits. When you shop
                for canned fruits, look for fruit that is packed in juice instead of syru
